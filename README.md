# RET-C2-058 — Meal Kit Planning Agent

> **Category**: Cat 2 (orchestrates multiple steps to accomplish a specific use case)
> **Industry**: RET

## Overview

Plans meal kits for shoppers at a convenience store. The caller sends a free-text
request (for example "plan 3 high-protein dinners and avoid shellfish"). Allergens to
avoid come from the request text ("avoid shellfish", "no dairy", "nut-free", "allergic to
eggs") and, optionally, from `declared_allergens` in the invocation context; both are
merged, normalised to canonical names and used only for the current request, never
stored. The agent classifies the request intent, retrieves candidate items from a
meal-kit catalogue and assembles an ingredient plan with preparation steps and a
nutrition summary. An ingredient that contains a declared allergen is never kept in the
plan: it is replaced by a safe substitute not already in the plan, or dropped. A final
allergen gate removes any conflicting ingredient that is still there, attaches a warning
for every excluded ingredient, and blocks the plan if a warning would be missing or no
allergen-safe ingredient is left.

Intent classification can use an injected LLM client; with no client (the default)
it falls back to deterministic keyword matching, and plan assembly is deterministic.
Retrieval accepts injectable keyword-index and vector-store clients; without them it
uses a small built-in sample catalogue, so out of the box the plans are illustrative.
Allergen parsing from text is deterministic and limited to the template's allergen
vocabulary (shellfish, fish, milk, egg, soy, peanut, tree nut, wheat, sesame and common
member words such as shrimp or dairy); it errs on the side of excluding an item.

Input: the request as a plain string (`input`), optional `declared_allergens` in the
invocation context. Output: a plan with `ingredients`, `steps`, `nutrition` and
`warnings`.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | 3.11 or later |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent raises
`PlatformRequired` during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and test specification
```

See `docs/02_design.md` for the design and `docs/03_test_spec.md` for the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
